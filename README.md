# AtChat

> The modern environment for you and your loved ones to chat ðŸ˜€. Taking personal conversations to another level ðŸš€

We have always wondered what is happening behind the tech companies which provide their chat services. Are they safe? Probably. Probably not. Times are so dark that there is a probability for your privacy! AtChat is an initiative by [Tanishq Daiya](https://github.com/tanishqdaiya/), [Nihal Sharma](https://github.com/NihalSharama), [Ashutosh](https://github.com/A7560) and [Anshaj Tripathi](https://github.com/anshaj-a) to fight for your right to privacy against the _[Big Brother of Human Connection](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/283/017/384.jpg)_. We have tried to make this application like no one has ever done before, its elegance, openness and simplicity stands out like nothing you have ever seen.
